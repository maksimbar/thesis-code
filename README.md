This monorepository contains all relevant code for the bachelor's thesis "Speech Noise Removal Using Convolutional Neural Networks". This work is based on the SDnCNN model for speech enhancement, as described in the paper: [Speech Enhancement using Convolutional Neural Network-based Spectrogram Denoising](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9467599).

The structure is as follows:
- `packages/demo` contains the source code for the [live site](https://maksimbar.github.io/thesis-code/packages/demo/) showcasing denoising examples
- `packages/results` contains training, testing, and experimental results
- `packages/model` contains the source code for the SDnCNN model with implemented modifications

> Each package includes a markdown file with relevant documentation
